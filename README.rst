twistit - Handy tools for the twisted framework
=============================================================

`twistit` is a collection of utilites for `twisted` that I've found
handy but too small to justify a dedicated project for each. 

This library is open source and released under the MIT License.

You can install it with `pip install twistit`. It doesn't need to
compile anything, so there shouldn't be any surprises. Even on Windows.
